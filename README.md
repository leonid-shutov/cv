# Projects

## Platform services

**Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, AWS, CDK, DynamoDB, Lambda, SQS, SNS, Step
Functions

### Description:
As a software engineer, I was part of a team mostly responsible for platform services (email service, virus scan service, notification service, PDF generation service, etc.) and various business-related services. All our services were built using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach with AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). I utilized a variety of AWS services and placed a strong emphasis on performance, conducting thorough benchmarks, tests, and metrics analysis to ensure optimal efficiency and reliability. Also contributed to various enterprise libraries that were widely used across multiple teams.

## Aggregator

**Stack**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, BullMQ, Puppeteer, React, Redux, GraphQL, MongoDB, Gatsby, Next.js, Apollo, Google Cloud,
CircleCi, Contentful, DataDog

### Description:

**Backend**: Responsible for multiple Node.js services, including a multi-tenant platform, web scraper, OAuth service, and enterprise libraries (metrics client, feature flags client, HTTP client, logger).

**Frontend**: Developed a React application that serves more than 1000 landing pages from the CMS and a long form composed of questions coming from a big variety of partners. The main challenge of the form was to create a no-code solution that would allow configuring questions in a JSON format keeping React components shared between different countries and integrations. Metaprogramming techniques were applied to define form behavior dynamically, streamlining configuration and enhancing flexibility.
